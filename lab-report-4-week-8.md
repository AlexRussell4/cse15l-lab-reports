# Week 8 Lab Report
**By Alex Russell**

This report goes over testing and debugging in multiple versions of MarkdownParse. The tests added correspond to the three markdown snippets that can be found in the week 8 lab report [prompt](https://ucsd-cse15l-w22.github.io/week/week8/).

The directories used in this report are [mine](https://github.com/AlexRussell4/markdown-parse) and the one I [reviewed](https://github.com/PierreBeur/markdown-parse) in week 7.
